This Project is based on Prediction of Interest Rates of Loans from the Lending Club Loan Data.
Please note that the prediction is focused on the borrowers with bad credit history.
Steps to Regenerate the Project:
1.    Clone the Project into any directory of your choice
2.    Download the Data from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data and rename it to “loan.csv”
3.    Make sure that “loan.csv”, “EDA.ipynb”, and “DataCleaningAndModeling.ipynb” exists in the same folder
4.    Examining, analyzing and understanding the data using Exploratory Data Analysis in the file “EDA.ipynb”
5.    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Random Forest and Linear Regression Model for interest rate prediction exists in the file “DataCleaningAndModeling.ipynb”
6.    Neural Network Model prediction, TPot exists in “NeuralNetworks.ipynb”
